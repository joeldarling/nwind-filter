Joel,

First off AMAZING README. I loved the clear instructions and animations. I had to troubleshoot some issues starting the app, but otherwise these were great.

You did a good job building the app to spec. I like how you use resolve to inject data into your controllers. And the filter directive looks sharp. Are there ways you could further directivize your employee view? Also, while server-side sorting is obviously part of the assignment, what are some ways you could do the filtering on the client side? To me, this would lead to a simpler app.

Good job using $broadcast for error handling. Are their other ways you could notify users of errs with some better UX? Toasts, notifications or displaying messages on the page instead of the console are all starts.

Great work, see you Tuesday!
