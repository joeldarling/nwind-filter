good work.. I think if you ended up returning a map for active letters things would be a little more interesting.

Also think about naming of the routes

/api/employees/letterMap =  would return an object like this:
{
A: true,
C: true,
...
X: true
}

wouldn't have to be in order.

Also take advantage of db--- don't fetch everything.. fetch just what you need.

You could also have used nested routes... this way you only have to get the 'map' once.

Good work though..

ah one more thing...

mongoose.model[req.params.db]... be careful!!!!
mongoose.model['User'].. oucheee!!!
